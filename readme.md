# 1. Idea: Sustainable intensification (SI): CA and ISFM
- Reduced tillage, crop rotation as CA practices 
- High yielding variety adoption, mineral fertilizer and organic fertilizer as ISFM. Organic fertilizer can be manure, compost or mulch.
Employing two stage multinational endogenous switching regression model, estimate the impact of SI on various outcomes (e.g., food expenditure, HDDS, experience of food insecurity, probability of being poor.)
